This project consists in a device which measures both water flow and volume rate utilizing the STM32F407VG microcontroller in the Espruino environment, programmed in javascript. It displays updated values for instant flow rate and the total volume in a 16x2 LCD monitor and also in a local web page, which can be acessed by a protected wi-fi network. It was made as a undergraduate project for Microcontrollers

Parts utilized:
STM32F407VG development board.
